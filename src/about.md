# Work Experience

I'm a DevOps engineer working for a tier 1 automotive supplier. Previously, I was a software engineer working on vehicle integration. In my time working for this company, I have learned how to interface with different vehicle CAN bus architectures, solve timing related issues, and write C++ code targeting embedded systems.

# Education

I graduated from [Lawrence Technological University](https://www.ltu.edu/) in 2014 with a BS in Computer Science. My concentrations in school were business software development and embedded systems.

# Projects

I work on a number of hobby projects in my spare time. I plan on making this blog a space where I can document lessons learned while working on my own projects.
